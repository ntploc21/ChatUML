The diagram starts with the user browsing products on the website, adding and removing items from the cart. The user then proceeds to checkout, which triggers a request for payment to the payment gateway. The user enters their payment details, and the payment gateway processes the payment. The payment result is then sent back to the website, which creates an order and sends it to the order processor. Finally, the order processor sends an order confirmation back to the website, which then sends it to the user.\n\n@startuml\ntitle E-commerce\nactor User\nactor Website\nparticipant \"Shopping Cart\" as Cart\nparticipant \"Payment Gateway\" as Gateway\nparticipant \"Order Processor\" as Processor\nUser -> Website: Browse products\nWebsite -> Cart: Add items to cart\nWebsite -> Cart: Remove items from cart\nUser -> Website: Checkout\nWebsite -> Gateway: Request payment\nGateway -> Website: Payment page\nUser -> Gateway: Enter payment details\nGateway -> Processor: Process payment\nProcessor -> Gateway: Payment result\nGateway -> Website: Payment result\nWebsite -> Processor: Create order\nProcessor -> Website: Order confirmation\nWebsite -> User: Order confirmation\n@enduml"},
